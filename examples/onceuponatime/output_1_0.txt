, oh so long ago…

Let me tell you about Twitter.

And self-publishing.

And sleeping alone.

Twitter is, hands down, my favorite social media site of all time. I’ve written about it here and here. As a means to connect with others, it’s unparalleled, in my opinion. I love hanging out and doing my thing while at home, on the road, or wherever. There are PLENTY of good books out there to help you learn how to make the most of it, so I won’t go over the basics here — but if you’re looking for some recommendations, take a look at 60 Days of Twitter: How to Build an Irresistible Brand and Network Like a Pro and Superchats: How to Turn Tweets Into Real Money.

As for social media in general, the more you use it, the more you’ll understand it. It’s pretty self-explanatory — use it to engage people, make friends, and build a network. With another network called Quiubook, I am able to run an entire convention virtually with volunteers. Quiubook is also used by self-publishing artists to enable people to buy books off of their blogs, or Twitter streams. From a reader perspective, while a chapter might be a free “give away,” the full book (with your art) is for sale.

I’d encourage EVERYONE out there to at least give Twitter a try. Free. Easy. And oh so fun! And get this — it’s doing great things for authors AND self-publishing artists. I’m one of thousands who can vouch for that.

Self-publishing… that’s another subject altogether. Like Twitter, I’ve written quite a bit about it at my author sites — along with podcasts. The basics — you write it, use an editor, design a cover, and market it. You can make a killing, but you have to work at it. Or, you can become a genuine pulp fiction writer. Plenty of this stuff exists out there (including some pretty fantastic writers who are borrowing from the pulp tradition. Personally, I like the “edgy” stuff — ehh… *cough*, right Josh?), but that’s just me.

Even if you never see another dime for the effort,

,' said Rendel absently. He was still staring at that point where the glacier fell away into the unseen waters of Sanxious Rapids, and his voice was far away, softer than the chirrups of birds or the crackle of ice-cold streams.

'Once upon a time,' repeated Jason, peering at Rendel hopefully, awaiting his conclusions.

Rendel fumbled in his belt pouch, produced the shell which he had taken from his belt to eat his dinner when interrupted by Lee's shout. Jason recognised it instantly, knew it for what it was with that peculiar sensation in his fingers, the way they had started to tingle as soon as he had reached under the bars of his cage so many weeks before. Rendel had come across it later – they had come across it jointly – and given Jason the better of its two halves because, he had said with his odd inflection which indicated acceptance of crowning irony that Jason was watching their footfalls like a cat at a mousehole, it would like as not be 'best for us both'.

'So who did they vote for?' asked Jason again instantly, and as ever, tentatively.

They had come across the habitat's ballot box on the second day they had been allowed into it, and Rendel had taken it over, the two of them laughing at the idea that someone was voting in Habitat according to the result of their own investigation; the habitat's citizens had been very kind to their intermediaries, accommodating them with supplies and food as it was all too cold to venture outside (although, to be fair, the habitat's icy-hearts agreement stated that was different – who was to say it didn't pertain to thirty peppercorns which suddenly appeared in a corner? You went where something extinct was meant to be, knife in hand, and took what you saw. All the more so, that was, when everyone's survival depended on it), and had gleefully allowed Jason to maraud through the middle chambers in search of food for his kind. The ballots consequently had been a direct insult, it seemed, the habitat had no intention of conforming to this new ruling… and it meant that all happy meetings with their long-lost brothers and sisters were to be crushed.

Jason leaned forward and scanned the shallows as Rendel stalled yet again. He took the shell in his hand and weighed it.

'Are you going to tell me what you see?'

, a woman was sick and tired of the catcalling and crude comments she received while walking down the street.

So, one day, she put on her waitress hat, stereotypical short frilly skirt and nametag, wrote 'Any comments?' on her stomach, put a pencil over her nipple and began walking down the road.

Imagine being this offended by comments about your body

These days, there are always inherent safety risks when you trigger the innate primate attraction pathogenic stimuli that trigger lust in poorly restrained males.

One group of feminists(people who are MGTOW(men going their own way)-ors) are pushing a new wave of salmon parrading from their agitated melting pot of commissars and nannies. They're strident and self-righteous feminists and ironically, they're easily triggered by the comments of others. They're angry, they're hurt, they want someone to pay, they fit right in with the rest.

They're so obsessed with their perceived oppression that all their feelings are now misdirected in anger. If they're not busy writing nasty things on a bathroom wall or rioting over an anti-abortion display, they just won't stop challenging how a lone woman chooses to do her job.

There's a thin line between humor and torment that one crosses when they stigmatize something like waitress' outfits, just to further their personal agenda. Jennifer Hassall, came up with a muse that made fun of horrible female mannerisms, but it's her choice to poke fun, not that of someone insulting her efforts just to get feed.

Sex sells. It's the same reason that scantily clad women canvas car lots trying to sell more vehicles. Men and women alike, work in ways to draw someone's attention, attention being something everyone loves, whether you pander to it or not.

It's your life.

Why get angry over what others think about how you dress.Trick question. You don't. Not that it was anyone's right to do so, but she willingly got into the uniform. You didn't force her into it. You're not taking any moral high ground here.

It's nature, it's our lot in life. Sex is a vocabulary. We parrot to attract, we mimic behavior to gain acceptance. And rather than to integrate in society and get along, or be different, unpredictable and exciting, the feminists have chosen to ostracize themselves.

 I was an ugly fat kid.









But I wasn't always that ugly.





Once upon a time, in what seems a century ago, I was this cute handsome kid.









I know the next picture probably doesn't fit the cute kid category, but look, it's me...





The first time I got a chain that would last longer than 6months I bought before school patties and milk for breakfast. And when I went to wrestling practice and school after breakfast I didn't eat any lunch. I always ate dinner, thanks to my parents who always loved me.





Notice my hair could have been combed...





So, basically, this is the only part of the story I want you to see. I always ate, I always ate a lot....









During the summer of 7th grade I began to go to the gym at least three times a week. I would work out for an hour, with weights, and do a bunch of aerobic work there. You know, they had Ronco matt machines, and I even enjoyed doing curls with those machines.









Either that summer, or in 8th grade, I bought a Bowflex with a gift card to Best Buy. It was Zac Brown. Yes. Zac Brown himself.









In 9th grade, I started to eat a breakfast in the morning before school. I would usually eat an egg and toast or an egg sandwich. This was usually in the 2nd half of my senior year. Halfway through 9th grade I bought myself a new laptop. The only thing I ever spent money on in my life, besides books, just for fun. It was Mac; a white MacBook Pro.





One summer I spent 3 or more hours a day on it, partook in tournaments all over the Internet and played a lot of Music-Hero. Chop Suey! that story had to be told from one of my favorite songs.









Let's move ahead a couple years to 10th grade-ish. I played football, something that boosted my ego. Weight lifting was not a big thing while I was on the team. I would lift 3 or 4 times a week on my own, as if I were a high school jock. I even Today, I know I cannot complain. I lived a pretty solid life in comparison to

I should have been known as Ms. Prime-Archuleta from the very beginning, right?I'm currently in school pursuing a B.S. degree in Business Administration. I have a high GPA right now, so I can talk about it recommend it. If you are looking for a cost-effective way to get an education, a B.S. in Business Administration is good option. It's easier than you think! I have always tried to make time for school, regardless of what was going on in my personal life. I dedicate time each day to school, and although this semester is tough, I plan to continue this in my future courses. Something that I learned over the summer is that I have a really bad attention span. Apparently I need a lot more breaks than most people. This semester, I plan to adjust my studies accordingly so that I can get at least 5 hours of studying and reading done during my school week.My favorite blogs are(like my style?),(this one gets my creative juices flowing!),(really inspiring quotes),(funneh!), and(meh). posted at 12:36 PM EST, Nov 27 2004 link safe here? brooklyn said:

, Mars was a relatively Earth-like world with liquid surface water.

That was many billions of years ago. By the time man had taken his first tottering steps on the Moon, Mars was probably a red, frozen ball. Although it was only 70% of the size of the Earth, its mass was less than half that of the Earth’s, which meant it could not retain the heat it received from the Sun in its earlier history.

So that wily old taxman, Gravity, took a few of those Earth orbits in Mars’ days, and confusion ensued…what? Oh, that was just the format. Sorry. Straightened that out in Chapter 1. Will continue with the following:

Mars, by this time, can’t retain the heat it receives from the Sun, now presumed to be a Red Dwarf. Yet, over Rodriguez’s twenty five years of painting, we see two moons and other evidence of activity on the surface. Signs of erosion indicates that the presence of one, possibly two intelligent races of creatures. In science fiction, I usually like to imagine the event that took place before the story began, even if it might seem to be confusing to the reader. In this case, suppose a green and blue planet turned into a red planet. The likely suspect is this cataclysmic event. All life was lost. Permanent freeze set in, and water froze. Over the passing of countless millenniums, an Earth race of intelligent humanoids may have escaped in advance of the cataclysm, making a home on Titan, more scientific in some ways, but in other ways…less. The cataclysm triggered at some future date. The two cultures that arose after were very different. The purists on the Earth rise by not interrupting evolution. The Titan cultures, on the other hand, do just that, using triads. On the contrary, in the case of humans, triad are a device to interrupt evolution and return ancient creatures to more primitive stages. In either case, note the discipline of the beings in one of the triads renting the dome-like environment from Freeman, and note the one in the purifying chamber and surrounding areas. The Head Never Changes. (Pick the first picture that pops up to see that one) These people have a Masters Degree in Discipline. And go on with their daily routine, undisturbed, despite what seems to us like a degree of chaos on other planets. They represent the influence of an old Earth education on

, I had two little brothers, Tony and Paul ….” Since Peter had proven that Ferley had a brother, and it’s logical that Ferley and Havilland would have called themselves “brothers,” such a proof should be even easier.

In an interview I conducted with him on May 31, 1992, in Aydincik, Havilland describes how, at age 22, he emigrated from Israel to the United States by breaking “the letter of Yekkeslav Bokhonosh,” who directed the emigration of Jews from Russia and Poland, including Havilland. I asked Havilland to identify his Yekkeslav Bokhonosh, but, mischievously, he insisted on identifying the Yekkeslav as (Jewish) actor Larry Brezner, whom he met “in ‘segyn di civiyl rom” (a Yiddish phrase he derides whenever he utters it in his writings.[14])[15] The real Yekkeslav Bokhonosh was described by Yivo Memsaab in volume 6, issue 2 — a publication of the New York-based YIVO Institute for Jewish Research — as being involved in an important and less publicized rescue of Polish Jews from Belarus and Lithuania between 1941 and 1945. Naum Lwowski, who describes Havilland’s struggles in the introduction to Dirty Yekkes, the astonishing autobiography he published in 1976,[16] describes how Havilland became, at age 22, “Lemikstn Kval_.” In YIVO Memsaab, the cognomen “Kval” (which translates to “kavlisch-oroses”) refers to the wonderful or guy: in other words, a trickster, all of which ties in to Havilland’s trickster naturey and his penchant for prestidigitation.

When the family’s rabbi opened the family’s storage capsule in 1990, he couldn’t find crucial documents such as birth certificates. When queried, Ferley could only respond, “Siz jetzt bramer var educate, di yeder fun di zun soldate" [Now, you can just organize] (Roderick A.

====================
, there was a beautiful creature who had lived his whole life in a regal, ornate castle. That was to say, he had never had any experience with the non-magical, and his parents didn't know anything else. So, as he ventured outside the safety of his castle, away from earth and sorcery, he noticed the sharp light of the sun, the stiff scent of earth, and, within the foliage all around him, there was also the fleeting, whispery language of the sylphs. It was confusing, but he didn't truly understand it.

They began to enlighten him, the language of nature, the language of land, the language of the stars, the language of the newly warming earth. They showed him their favourite things, the fairies and the deals they had made with the squashes, the responsibilities they had undertaken in order to provide the kind vegetables with their thick, protective cloaks and the garlic for the fairies' stinging hands as they fought off demons. It seemed to him unnatural, seeing the fairies have to fight something; then again, perhaps fighting was their nature, and he found himself admiring the image, those silver-skinned stick-insects, brandishing their stings so bravely, their little antennae twitching up and down as they made their hissing curses at their superiors, their posture irresistible and full of never-ending pride. They told him that he was the first, magical beings who had overcome their mutations; they told him that his ancestors had been mere wisps, but still gifted in their way, able to fly quickly to catch their prey—something that was not important now because there were very few dragons out here. That still made him sad, but he felt that it was an acceptable loss.

Once-upon-a-time, there had been a magical creature who had been seven hundred feet long and filled with thick, liquid gold that beat instead of blood. That was to say, he had never had any experience with the non-magical, and for the entirety of his life, he never intended to keep his eyes open to any alternative vision of truth. But then something clangorous and painful slid out beneath his jawbones, making his teeth fall out one by one until he realised the cause, and then his body regenerated in fire.

He opened his eyes to a different world, to nature and earth already there—but they looked much more fragile, like they could be
====================
." I say all this politely and laugh a little nervously. I see Jane Winton sitting at a table over on my left. I feel a rush of shame and fury. I want to rush over and slap every condescending smile off her face. Winton pretends not to see me. We are not on such good terms. "I think we need to get back to the agenda," I say. "There's just a bit more."

"No, just a moment," says Malcolm. He gives me a little wave. "Could we have your attention? Could we ask you please to give us your attention for a moment." Then he draws his long legs up under the table so that he can reach out for my hand across it.

I falter. What is about to happen here? Is there some crisis at Acclaim? Some terrible threat; perhaps a management buyout and the takeover of the company? There is a hushed silence in the room. Malcolm gives my hand a brief squeeze and then rubs his knuckle gently on my wedding ring. I shudder in puzzlement. Maybe I'm just tired; it's been a long day. Anyway, I don't want to humiliate the man so I let him continue. "I'd like to tell you a story," he says. "Once upon a time a—young girl joins an esteemed medical firm and finds herself in a rather unusual situation."

"Pray continue," I manage to murmur.

His grip tightens on my hand. "So there she is, you see, a bright new young woman, just beginning her career—and she finds herself working for a certain esteemed colleague who doesn't seem to appreciate her talents and abilities. A certain married man who pays her a little too much attention."

I feel a cold fear enter my blood as this nightmare delivers me yet another scenario: I picture myself in an audience, a large drab institutional sort of room with municipal lighting, and a social worker, someone like Lyn Black, standing at a lectern and in a tone of great seriousness saying: "Perhaps if the Jane Wintons of the world, who spend all day 'Doing Well by Doing Good, Doing Good by Doing Well,' didn't take advantage of vulnerable, struggling young women like Laura Weiss, all those good citizens who had worked so tirelessly to sway public opinion on behalf of lynch law and popular hemlock might finally begin to consider the vital impact of compassionate systems of justice and

 there was a village. Beyond it lay a dark,

forest. There everyone lived peacefully. And just in front

of a village the forest of nonthought began. And just

there a nice girl of sixteen lived.

One day she went walking into the forest, to discover

something nice. She came to a shiny spot on the ground

– a fallen star, Her golden hair reached to the ground.

She is still standing there. She does not eat much because

she is very sad that nothing will happen and realize her.

It is impossible for you to realize her, so I cannot problematize.

Venus is how a dilema becomes, how a evenness,

how a torture. It is not your problem.

I do not mean that very soon Russian constructivists

will appear, and also European soldiers come with their

military jackboots to established norm. It is not your

life, it is a coincidence, a miracle. It is a Holiday of

St. Maria, but on this market, on this market you sell your

tooth, ha ha ha. Even if you try it is necessary to understand.

You need to use your free will. It is as sweet as I am,

but you have to complete the work, you should go

back to work. Every tottled: frrr. Look: we are talking

when you are on the telephone. Do not think that my

scribblings in the toilet are authentic. Meanwhile, you

cannot shut up, you try to get to know. By evening

lotus seeds are far from where you left them, you do not

notice, you ran off to have dinner, and then it is too late.

I believe that life is a miracle. As fine as a dropped really

invisible meat.

But this does not prevent meat from decaying. A society

is a decay of meat in which we live.

Once you looked in a mirror. You asked,

“Where is my nose?” And what about long hair?

It was some strange petrified mineral fiber. After death

you go through a terrible hardship. You call it success. All your

face is black. Are my fingers long, long, shooosh. You give
