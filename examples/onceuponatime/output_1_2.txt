, in the 1940s and 1950s, glass was made locally in East Lambeth and Battersea. In 1963/64, South London Glass, by now one of the main suppliers of glass to London Builders merchants, relocated to St Helens, Merseyside. [7] From the 1960s onwards the supply of 'glass' from the USA and Italy, i.e. float glass [8] meant that neither local glass blowing nor production of specialist glass developed in London: this ended all that.[9]



Rebroadcasting the london overspill studios of german and envy tvc during the 1990s and 2000s, the glass building in Lambeth North started to tell a different story, one of colour and of the sanitising of industry, a history which ended in 1965 with a '60s population boom and the contemporary one of gentrification and social cleansing?



In 2011 the south British coastline was found to be growing at a rate faster than Berlin, allowing it to be cultivated by 75 different marine species and more than 200 species of plant. David Attenborough’s The Trials of Life series states that 'as our coastlines continue to erode, human encroachment on land will cause the coastline’s leaked sediment to be deposited just a little further inland.' [11] The book states that

'working in London is especially damaging, principally because its eroding coastline is home to a wide variety of unusual marine cordgrass species that were traditionally used for thatching.' [12]

Also in 2011 Britain’s coastline is predicted to move 30 metres further inland by 2030, following the immense damage done to the shore in the 1850s. [13]

 and nation is society arranged by objects in the foreground or background of the popular mind; or they appear in a series of connected scenes; or such a thought becomes a text; or they are turned into a sentence; or a phrase now omitted that was one of the premises is made to serve as a conclusion. Even when the narrator forgets loose ends of the sentence, but we fill them in and we can engender. Even when the narrator has committed an error, we rack our brains to correct the error, we feel if we have got the wrong idea out of it. When such stories are being told in both periods, primary periods or historical periods, there are certain ramifications, what we call cultural or psychological structures different from bedtime stories. That is the reason why the stories of ideological contents in recent days are to be found in all periods and among all peoples. There are definite depths of meaning in these stories, including folktales, myths, fables, and also the more recent stories, such as fairy tales, which are only being ousted at the moment, and the legends, which under modern conditions in the West, particularly the US, which has become mondialized, are being ousted by more realistic stories and very advanced scientific and naturalistic tales.

What is the meaning of form? Apart from the fact that a form, such as mimesis, can be imitated and learned by small children, even by animals, we have to see the effect produced by the mere recitation of a sentence, especially a sentence in verse. It seems to be the sound of a drum or gong or which reminds one of music. It acts like music, it has a rhythm, it has a sequence of movements, of tones, of pitch, of harmony. We might remember the effect produced by a poem when it is heard for the first time. Someone tells us a poem as an anecdote, we are excited, maybe, by its content, and the language in which it is expressed. One hears a lyric poem, and the heart moves. That is why, cultures seek the presence of a bard, as well as musicians and singers. Obviously there is virtue of music in man. I can think of something I read in Polybius, which is that the Romans at certain periods thought moral instruction could best be conveyed by eunuchs reciting odes, not only in the prose sections, but also in the verse sections of the history, the odes being accompanied by a kind of flute in order

The computer placed before it an enormous dictionary, a multifaceted crystal and a colourful collection of boxes. And then it began writing in the first row of the first page.

Before the computer adopts the position over the first letter of the first word,

a melody begins winding itself out of the labyrinthine depths of its memory.

The melody increases in strength and vigor, transforming into a light, swift and wistful march...

, Ron the Chump thought it would be a brilliant idea to give Harry the genetic memories of a ‘famous dark wizard’ and then attempt to suppress said memories with a permanent Obliviation. He later realised his mistake and removed the Obliviation with an Elixie.

Instead of making Harry forget and have no emotion for a dark wizard and all he did, Harry has been trying to understand everything, in the hopes of ‘winning’ Voldemort’s fate. Which, by the way, is NOT possible, as the horcruxes never left anchors to Voldemort’s soul, so when it was destroyed, so was Voldemort.

Now Harry has already let’s say 99.99% of his magic stay neutral as a fail-safe that the Baracks and other Dark Lords may never realise. 100% is something that Harry doesn’t want to cross, since not only it won’t grant him near immortality as Hogwarts’ batshit administrators (a plothole they are trying to solve now by accepting a NATURAL reincarnation license by the Potters) but it will also force his friends to make the most terrible choice of their lives, to save or murder him.

They may choose the later, and Harry might even not be the only one who the choice is made. It’s something I’m pretty sure Voldemort would choose to murder Harry and if Voldemort is murdered trying to survive, I’m sure hiskkkelf!shall kill his friends for cheating death before.

However, it is certain with such monopoly the British government has over magic in UK and knowing Harry has the possibility to know and perform every spell of EVERY book in the British Library and every book in the whole web Harry will ever access- once Harry is shown a spell from a book Surgeon won’t-dare charge him with any law, as he hasn’t broken one yet.

I see that as a vital part in the war against Voldemort and we all know Voldemort loves laws so no matter if he’s in Azkaban or not they will be charged against him. Voldie is like a mafia and the does respect-to a certain level when given- , rules.

This isn’t really going off topic if we think that every single war fought by any man has for purpose something related to this. So I’m happy to stay here for a long time.

, a Republican could be a strict conservative on one social issue, an environmentalist, a supporter of civic causes ranging from Tolerance to farm aid, and even an internationalist on the need for the U. S. to lead the world he filled in the blanks himself. When American voters of all stripes abandoned complex positions, they fled directly or nominally to the GOP; and perhaps indirectly — say, by being disillusioned with Jimmy Carter’s Liberalville — to Ronald Reagan. The Gipper’s combination of centralized power and free markets was odd, but it was still comprehensible: to most voters, the words “conservative” and “Republican” once had distinctly non-negative meanings. The Republican president’s title was “one of the most powerful forces for conciliation that has ever existed, ” exulted The Saturday Evening Post in 1922, referring to the most revered and far-travelled political figure of the day, Warren G. Harding. Agree with the 84th president’s decisions or not, there was a seductive unconscious logic behind them. After Clyde Prestowitz and David Frum left, you had to wonder if anyone else was still following the logic.

It didn’t help that Prestowitz was thumb-gnawing his way through some fairly unripe fruit, ix i. e., Ross Perot’s anti-NAFTA imperialism, David Horowitz’s abortion ban, even the anti-PC screeds of Interest of the United States professor John J. Miller. “Of all the works published on the anti-black undertones in America’s storytelling, the most insightful is Franz Boas’s introduction to The Shaping of American Grammar,” Prestowitz offered in august formality. Superficially, my forebears might have sought to eschew the patricians’ culture, but to co exist they needed to crack the Club’s rules of manners. Only study of the value judgments embedded in language and grammatical form can tell us how to avoid the errors of our parents and grandparents. Boas may have hoped his Eco phonetic principles would help break the false front of correct usage and reveal the common heritage of linguistic patterns across languages. ”10 David Frum felt right at home, for he cringes away from quotation marks wherever he bled John J.

====================
, when Vampire: The Masquerade was just beginning to come out, it was very hard to find a group you could play with, and it would often take a long time to do so.

As a pre-existing tabletop roleplaying interest became a Vampire dealer, it was natural to put those two things together.

There was no tabletop roleplaying culture in the same way there is now. And the players were all enthusiasts.

And every community has its own unique quirks. And, as anyone who’s drawn a table map for sci-fi (or D&D) know, the locations are extremely important.

So it shouldn’t come as a huge surprise that in Vampire, “Phoenix” and “Rome” are both coterminal. In other words, they’re different spaces in the same location.

In the book, “Rome” is referenced. From the animal entries, it seems to be a chorus of giant bats. It doesn’t mean it couldn’t at some point move globally, but that’s a small possibility. The biggest is walking the Iron Road – the ocean. In the battle of Shadow and Flesh book, it’s revealed that some Elder in the present is doing this. Saulot himself is slowly becoming it.

Rome existed in what would be considered Gaul, but it wasn’t Italy. Eventually, it was either destroyed or relocated to its modern location.

GMW was the first reference to the Roman version of the Awakened. But due to the rather restrictive theme of the book, it was best to present the Babylonian version really strongly, as it was a treasure hunt and had a delicious heart eating curse. So Babylon – Mesopotamia – was discussed to present the Pumpkin King, a society obsessed with Necromantic arts including both vampires and homunculi, as well as the concepts of Kebabs and whips applied to faces.

There was no faith involved. Originally this was intended as a light prank in order to have off-beat Hussite larping to contrast the spartan, mystic and singularly pointed portrayal of their prophecies – but that wasn’t used in this book. The closest variant on this was the Foresaken, a sect of the False Traditions, which doesn’t believe that Michael was part of the Alliance. They only believe that a connection to

 I made a deal with a coach. I was to throw 50 BP sessions a month and to do three in a day during the week. It was a good deal for both of us. The coach made lots of money so driving me to the different parks made sense for him and I needed to do more so has evolved into being that way. I was 20 then and I am 39 now so it's one thing to experience as a young guy but when you get older it becomes more complicated. Don't get me wrong I still get excited to throw but it's also about staying healthy and making being enjoyment not a pain in the ass. I can see guys USSA opponents walk from the bus to the field and to the throwing cages like it was 100 yards which is when you know somethings wrong.The coaches will express concerns about ME and I tell them I'm doing this because I know it's the best for me and they will tell me the same about their athletes..the main thing for us should be to just keep fresh.Triathlon season for me is eight month season and I throw four year. Most guys will not have this problem and it's quite the contrary but we all have our own problems to solve and for me this time of year is "soak it up " time. This can happen from years of doing the same thing so once I decided to pick myself up I try to help everyone else so they can solve the same solution. If not for me then for them.I still put emphasis in myself for my throwing but it's more to not neglect it and the most important thing is to always try to improve which hopefully will solve all the other obstacles. Many throwers make the mistake of not putting enough exercises in boxing but then think that spending 8 hours a day to just throw will fix it. I throw lightly before running or going out for a ride so that helps a little and then throw for quite a bit before the higher volume portion starts and also nap in between inside on off days which is a must have deal. It's also why I will not eat within 2-3 hours of throwing. That way I can keep throwing without risking that everything I eat will show up after I throw. In fact I can't throw if I eat and it's best and makes sense to me to not eat 2-3 hours before a workout. Otherwise all this info will sound like nonsense.What's done before the running is different from what's done before swimming but if I can learn anything from the arm it would be

Meet me in the back row.

The end of that sentence is and that means something like ". And I was powerless to stop it."

In my late teens, I heard a rough singer named Lucinda Williams at the then notorious Mango’s night spot in Alameda. Good night, everybody!

Ah, me. Ah, me.

It couldn’t be anything but the blues.

Tell me, ________________ering teacher, when you didn't know what else to do to teach me you couldn't send me off to direct traffic.

Ah, me. Ah, me.

Even as a teenager, I knew what I was hearing, you know. Yeah, you know. Tell me, ___________ing teacher, when you didn't know what else to do to teach me you couldn't send me off to direct traffic.

Ah, me. Ah, me.

Look down upon a rapper from High-muelin. But I was too smart to let my thoughts become your thoughts.

I always be po' Billy and if I didn't you probably wouldn't forgive me til I was a young man.

Ah, me.

Cave in a bearskin with the baton stetson. All those poor crooks, but don't worry I'm not coming back any time soon.

Ah, me. Ah, me. Or: Ah, me.

Yeah, I started work on another book. And one day this poem, my Dear Lucy poem, nearly sent me into a weeping fit from which it took a friend to rescue me, remind me who it was I knew to be the Lucy Lui of my troubled mind, see, it was my sweet mother, you get it here, I would later almost cry happy tears that I owed it to my mother never to forget her qualities, you know.

Oh, she's not the Tuscan Madonna

Under clouds can almost see her standing

By some horse at sunset riding west

Heaven is how she feels all the beaches just begin to creep

Over her shoulders softly.

And every day up on Bow Bridge

By the water of a sultry city stream

I do think she's mad, dear Simon,

Never mean, heartburn or constipation,

, all this decision making about teen rules and consequences was so confusing. Now it’s getting easier every day, but that’s only because I’m learning from the past. Never sacrifice the present on your path to the future. Remember, you haven’t had your time machine yet. Don’t waste a second on negativity, otherwise your time machine will never kick in.


Elie Wiesel is a fascinating man. I’ve been thinking about the fact that he received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1986, but I’m not sure why things changed so much in his native country, Communist Romania.

I’ve learned that the ship he was on when he was hit by falling bodies was called the Reunion. To me, the ironic pain of this name is difficult, and I’m not even remotely Jewish and neither were my grandparents. It makes me think.

I don’t want to think about the despair of those who were separated from their family members at some terrible time in history or the fact that my parents could have met under different circumstances. The havoc wreaked by time machines.

I’m not here to vituperate history—just the people in it. The idea that the day after his bar mitzvah, his town was occupied by Nazis, and because he had no means of communication with the outside world, he and all his family were sent to a concentration camp, and then a camp where he was the only survivor, goes far beyond crazy.

He describes people who had “irises that reflected no light.” Doesn’t really say much about them except that they were no longer people who reflected light. They’d lost their shine. How is that?

Everything about him and everything about his experience is so harrowing. I sometimes wonder how I would have survived these harrowing trials had I been sandwiched in them—would I still be the world-class snot rag I am now? How many layers of skin would I be sporting were I dropped into the penalty box, I mean the gas chamber, at Auschwitz? But many survived, so why didn’t he? I could tell you what I learned from what has happened, but how much do you want to know?

During my Mad magazine years, I saw Elie Wiesel on a cover with a hologram strip pasted to his forehead. He appeared to be thinking,
